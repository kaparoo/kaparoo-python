# `kaparoo.filesystem`

`pathlib`-based filesystem helpers.

## Modules

- [`existence`](./existence.py) — boolean predicates (`*_exists`) and
  validating `ensure_*` variants
- [`directory`](./directory.py) — `make_dir(s)`, `dir_empty(s)` /
  `dir_not_empty(s)` with validation, plus `_unsafe` variants that skip
  pre-checks
- [`utils`](./utils.py) — `stringify_path(s)`, `wrap_path(s)`,
  `reserve_path(s)`, `ensure_file_extension`
- [`staged`](./staged.py) — `StagedFile` / `StagedDirectory`, safe
  (atomic) writers usable as a context manager or explicitly
- [`exceptions`](./exceptions.py) — `DirectoryNotFoundError`, `NotAFileError`
- [`types`](./types.py) — `StrPath`, `StrPaths` type aliases
- [`search/`](./search/) — composable filesystem search (own README)

All public symbols are re-exported from the top-level `kaparoo.filesystem`
namespace.

## Existence checks

`*_exists` return a bool; `ensure_*` raise on failure and return the
(optionally stringified) path.

```python
from kaparoo.filesystem import (
    dir_exists, ensure_dir_exists, ensure_files_exist, file_exists,
)

if file_exists("config.toml"):
    ...

# Single path: raises FileNotFoundError / NotAFileError / NotADirectoryError
config = ensure_dir_exists("var/cache", make=True)  # create if missing
report = ensure_dir_exists("var/cache", make=0o755)  # mode bits: POSIX only

# Bulk with a shared root; each entry is resolved relative to it.
files = ensure_files_exist(
    ["a.txt", "b.txt"],
    root="data",
)
```

## Exception hierarchy

`DirectoryNotFoundError` subclasses `FileNotFoundError`, so callers may
catch the broader type:

```python
from kaparoo.filesystem import DirectoryNotFoundError, ensure_dir_exists

try:
    ensure_dir_exists("var/missing")
except FileNotFoundError:  # catches DirectoryNotFoundError too
    ...
```

## Creating and emptying directories

```python
from kaparoo.filesystem import (
    dir_empty, dir_not_empty, dirs_empty, make_dir, make_dirs,
)

cache_dir = make_dir("var/cache", exist_ok=True)

# Start from a clean slate: wipe an existing directory's contents and
# recreate it empty. Destructive, and only ever wipes a *directory* (a
# non-directory -- or a symlink -- at the path still raises). `clean=True`
# makes `exist_ok` moot, since the directory is removed and remade.
run_dir = make_dir("out/run_42", clean=True)

# Bulk creation with a shared root
make_dirs(["logs", "tmp"], root="var", exist_ok=True)

# Empty checks (raise if missing or not a directory)
assert dir_empty(cache_dir)
assert dirs_empty(["logs", "tmp"], root="var")

# ...and their negations
(cache_dir / "data.bin").touch()
assert dir_not_empty(cache_dir)
```

Each check has a negated counterpart (`dir_not_empty`, `dirs_not_empty`);
`dirs_not_empty` is True only when *every* directory is non-empty. The
`_unsafe` variants (`dir_empty_unsafe`, `dir_not_empty_unsafe`,
`dirs_empty_unsafe`, `dirs_not_empty_unsafe`) skip existence/type
validation and are intended for hot paths where the caller has already
validated.

## Path manipulation

`stringify_path(s)` converts to forward-slash strings, optionally
trimming a leading or trailing portion. `wrap_path(s)` prepends and/or
appends path components, rejecting absolute inputs where ambiguous.

```python
from pathlib import Path
from kaparoo.filesystem import stringify_path, stringify_paths, wrap_path

# "path/to/file.txt" on every platform (including Windows)
stringify_path(Path("path") / "to" / "file.txt")

# Trim leading or trailing components
stringify_path("a/b/c", after="a")     # "b/c"
stringify_path("a/b/c", before="c")    # "a/b"

# Bulk stringify with a shared base.
stringify_paths(["data/a.txt", "data/b.txt"], after="data")  # ["a.txt", "b.txt"]

# Compose paths without joining manually
wrap_path("logs", prepend="var", append="server.log")  # var/logs/server.log
```

`ensure_file_extension` is a pure (no filesystem) extension check: it
requires a `.<ext>` final suffix, raising `ValueError` otherwise. `ext` may
be a single extension or an iterable of acceptable ones; the leading dot is
optional and the match is case-insensitive. `add=True` mirrors `make` on
`ensure_dir_exists` — it appends the (first) extension when the path has no
suffix (`np.save`-style) instead of raising; a *wrong* suffix still raises.

```python
from kaparoo.filesystem import ensure_file_extension

ensure_file_extension("data.bin", "bin")             # Path("data.bin")
ensure_file_extension("data.txt", "bin")             # ValueError
ensure_file_extension("out/00000_phase", "bin")      # ValueError (no suffix)

# Any of several accepted extensions:
ensure_file_extension("img.jpeg", ("jpg", "jpeg", "png"))  # Path("img.jpeg")

ensure_file_extension("out/00000_phase", "bin", add=True)  # Path("out/00000_phase.bin")
ensure_file_extension("out/data.txt", "bin", add=True)     # ValueError (wrong suffix)
```

## Reserving a destination

`reserve_path` guards a path that should *not* yet exist, so you don't
clobber something when creating a new file or directory there. It only
checks (and optionally creates the parent) — it never creates or deletes
the target itself.

```python
from kaparoo.filesystem import reserve_path

# Raises FileExistsError if out/run.json exists; otherwise creates the
# missing parent directory and returns the path ready to write to.
out = reserve_path("out/run.json", make_parents=True)
out.write_text("{}")

# `exist_ok` (named as in make_dir / Path.mkdir) is a non-destructive
# bypass: it suppresses the conflict but deletes nothing, so a later write
# overwrites in place.
out = reserve_path("out/run.json", exist_ok=True)

# `reserve_paths` is the bulk form (fail-fast on the first conflict). It
# takes no `root`; compose with `wrap_paths` to share a base directory.
from kaparoo.filesystem import reserve_paths, wrap_paths
a, b = reserve_paths(wrap_paths(["a.bin", "b.bin"], prepend="out"))
```

For a *directory* destination, `make_dir(..., exist_ok=...)` both guards
and creates it; for an exclusive *file* create, the stdlib `open(path,
"x")` raises the same `FileExistsError` directly. Reach for `reserve_path`
when you want the check (and parent setup) decoupled from the creation.

`reserve_path` is intentionally **non-destructive** — it never removes an
existing target. To start a directory from a clean slate, use the
`clean` option on `make_dir` / `make_dirs` (see below), which is the only
destructive operation here and is named to say so.

## Safe (atomic) writes

`StagedFile` saves a file safely: it stages the content in a temporary file
in the destination's own directory and moves it into place only on commit.
A reader never sees a half-written file, and a failed write leaves any
existing file untouched. It works as a context manager — commit on a clean
exit, discard on an exception — or explicitly, like a file object.

```python
from kaparoo.filesystem import StagedFile

# Text (the default), as a context manager: commit on success, discard
# on error.
with StagedFile("out/report.json", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    f.write(json.dumps(data))  # an exception here leaves out/ untouched

# Binary mode, explicitly: write, then commit (or abort to discard).
f = StagedFile("out/data.bin", binary=True)
f.write(payload)
f.commit()  # returns the destination Path; idempotent
```

The default is text (`StagedFile[str]`) with optional `encoding` / `newline`,
as with `open`; pass `binary=True` for a binary writer (`StagedFile[bytes]`).
The type parameter follows the mode, so `write` and `file` are typed `str`
or `bytes` accordingly.

With `overwrite=False` (the default) an existing destination raises
`FileExistsError` up front, and the commit creates the file atomically —
never clobbering a file that appeared meanwhile. With `overwrite=True` the
destination is replaced in one atomic step, keeping its previous
permissions. Pass `make_parents=True` to create the destination's parent
directory if it is missing. An uncommitted writer (an explicit instance
dropped without `commit()`) discards its staged file on garbage collection,
so a partial write is never promoted by accident.

The committed file gets the usual umask-based permissions.

`StagedDirectory` is the directory counterpart: you populate its `workdir`
(a temporary directory in the destination's parent) and it is moved into
place on commit.

```python
from kaparoo.filesystem import StagedDirectory

with StagedDirectory("out/dataset", make_parents=True) as d:
    (d.workdir / "train.json").write_text(payload)
    (d.workdir / "shards").mkdir()
# out/dataset appears in one step; an exception would leave it absent
```

Creating a new directory (`overwrite=False`) is atomic — a single rename.
Replacing an existing one (`overwrite=True`) is *not* fully atomic: the old
directory is swapped aside and removed, so there is a brief window where the
destination is absent and, on a rare failure mid-swap, the previous contents
remain in a sibling `<name>.old` directory for recovery.

`commit` makes the directory's appearance durable (it fsyncs the parent
entry), but the files you write into `workdir` are *not* individually
fsynced; if their contents must survive a crash right after commit, fsync
them yourself (e.g. write each via `StagedFile`). For the create path,
concurrent readers always see the complete directory regardless; the
overwrite replace has the brief absent window noted above.

## Platform notes

- **Directory mode bits**: `mode` (on `make_dir` / `make_dirs`) and
  `make=<int>` (on `ensure_dir_exists` / `ensure_dirs_exist`) are
  validated against the `0o1`–`0o7777` range and applied to the created
  directory on **POSIX systems only**. On Windows, mode values are still
  accepted (so cross-platform code stays clean) but the range check is
  skipped and the OS ignores the bits — see
  [`os.mkdir`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.mkdir).
- **Path separators**: `stringify_path` and `stringify_paths` normalize
  backslashes to forward slashes on Windows. Functions that return
  strings via `stringify=True` (`make_dir`, `ensure_dir_exists`,
  `wrap_path`, ...) inherit this normalization. If you need a native
  Windows path string, call `str(path)` directly on a `Path`.
