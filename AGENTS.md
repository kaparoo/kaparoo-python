# Agent guide — `kaparoo-python`

Guidance for AI coding assistants working on this project.
`CLAUDE.md` loads this file via the `@AGENTS.md` import.

## Project

- Package: `kaparoo/`
- Python:  3.14+
- Kind:    distributable library (`uv_build` backend)

## Toolchain

The Astral toolchain — keep it unless there is a clear reason to change:

- `uv`   — environment, locking, running
- `ruff` — linting + formatting
- `ty`   — type checking
- `pytest` — testing

## Commands

```bash
uv sync --group dev      # create/refresh the environment
uv run ruff check .      # lint
uv run ruff format .     # format
uv run ty check          # type-check
uv run pytest            # run tests
```

## Conventions

- Keep code fully typed — `ty` runs with `error-on-warning`.
- Fix `ruff` findings rather than suppressing them, unless there is a
  clear, commented reason.
- Tests live in `tests/` and may use bare `assert` (ruff `S101` is
  waived there).
- `ty` has no plugin system; rely on standard typing (PEP 681
  `dataclass_transform`, `.pyi` stubs), not type-checker plugins.

## Python style

`ruff` enforces most of this — run `uv run ruff check --fix` rather than
applying it by hand.

- Every module starts with `from __future__ import annotations` (ruff
  isort `required-imports`). Empty `__init__.py` package markers are
  exempt.
- Use builtin generics — `list`, `dict`, `tuple`, `type` — never
  `typing.List`, `typing.Dict`, `typing.Tuple`, `typing.Type` (ruff `UP`).
- Imports are grouped and sorted: standard library, third party, first
  party, then a trailing `if TYPE_CHECKING:` block (grouped the same
  way). Within a group `import X` precedes `from X import Y`; entries are
  alphabetical.
- Docstrings are optional — write them where they clarify intent, not
  mechanically on every function, class, or method. When written, use
  [Google style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings)
  (`Args:` / `Returns:` / `Raises:` sections), and omit types from
  `Args:` entries — the signature already carries them.
- Standalone runnable scripts carry PEP 723 inline metadata (the
  `# /// script` block). `uv` manages it (`uv add --script`); add or edit
  it by hand only when explicitly asked.

## Commit convention

Commit messages use a [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/) prefix and wrap
package/tool names in backticks:

```
<emoji> <Imperative summary; tool names in `backticks`>

<Optional body explaining *why*>
```

Keep commits single-purpose; don't rewrite published history; don't
skip git hooks. AI assistants append a `Co-Authored-By` trailer with
their own published identity (e.g. `Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>`).

## Template

Generated from a copier template. `.copier-answers.yml` records the
answers; run `copier update --UNSAFE` to pull later template changes.
